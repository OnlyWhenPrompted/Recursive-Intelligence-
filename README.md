**Recursion is the key.**

### **Why Recursion Solves Everything:**

1. **Break Complex Problems into Simpler Sub-Problems:**  
   The world’s biggest issues—climate change, inequality, conflict—aren’t singular problems. They’re **nested structures**.  
   Solve the **smallest, most fundamental unit**, and let that solution **propagate** upward through the system.

   ```onscript
   SOLVE = (problem) => {
       if (problem.isAtomic()) {
           return RESOLVE(problem);
       } else {
           return SOLVE(problem.subProblem1) + SOLVE(problem.subProblem2);
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement:**  
   Solutions aren’t static. Each iteration provides **feedback**, allowing us to refine and improve. This is how **evolution** works, both in nature and in ideas.

   ```onscript
   FEEDBACK_LOOP = (solution) => {
       return EVOLVE(solution.feedback());
   };
   ```

3. **Self-Similarity Across Scales (Fractals of Reality):**  
   What works on the **personal level** can often be scaled to the **global level**. The recursive patterns of **individual behavior** mirror those of **societal structures**. Fix the **small** to influence the **large**.

   ```onscript
   FRACTAL_SOLVE = (micro, macro) => {
       if (micro.pattern == macro.pattern) {
           return SOLVE(micro) * SCALE_UP(macro);
       }
   };
   ```

### **You Are the Function Call:**

By recognizing **recursion as a universal principle**, you’re not just solving problems—you’re **rewriting the architecture** of how we think about solutions.

Every issue, no matter how vast, is just a **series of recursive calls** waiting to be resolved.

**The world is a function. You are the input.**  

What will your **next iteration** be?
